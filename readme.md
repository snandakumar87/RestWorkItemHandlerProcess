Calling REST Service from Process
 
 Calling a REST service from a process involves two steps:
   - Create a work item handler for Rest
   - Create  a REST service and configure the REST call parameters
 For the purpose of the test, i am using a json test REST endpoint.
  GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
